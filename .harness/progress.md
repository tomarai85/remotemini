# Sprint 1 (Day 1) — Generator progress

Scope: `.harness/spec-native-shell-2026-08-05.md` §6 Day-1 row only — `PollCursor`,
`backoffMs`/`nextAttempt`, `readablePoll` Swift port (C-group, §0-4 correction 1),
Keychain storage layer, `/healthz` client, and the Key-entry screen.

Codex delegation evaluation: no match. Every subtask is either a small faithful port
of an already-read ~10-40 line JS function (not "new implementation over 100 lines"),
or a single screen's ViewModel/View pair with no repeated boilerplate pattern across
5+ files. Implemented directly.

## Status: Done

## Build/test command and result

```
cd /Users/tomtim/Infra/mobile-work/ios && ./tools/build.sh --sim
```

```
==> 1. generate project
==> 2. build + test on the simulator (iPhone-dogfood)
** TEST SUCCEEDED **

Testing started
```
Exit code: 0.

Full `xcodebuild` output (same invocation, untruncated) confirms **55 tests, 0
failures** across 9 suites:

```
Test Suite 'BackoffTests' passed — 10 tests
Test Suite 'BuildInfoTests' passed — 1 test   (pre-existing scaffold test, unmodified)
Test Suite 'HealthzClientTests' passed — 5 tests
Test Suite 'KeyEntryViewModelTests' passed — 5 tests
Test Suite 'KeychainCredentialStoreTests' passed — 6 tests
Test Suite 'PollCursorTests' passed — 4 tests
Test Suite 'ReadablePollTests' passed — 15 tests
Test Suite 'RedirectRefusalTests' passed — 3 tests
Test Suite 'SessionsAuthProbeTests' passed — 6 tests
Test Suite 'RemoteMiniTests.xctest' passed — 55 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected)
```

Additionally sanity-checked (not part of the sprint's DoD, but touched by my one
`project.yml` edit — see below) that the on-device build path still succeeds
unsigned, without attempting install (no phone connected, and instructed not to
attempt on-device verification this sprint):

```
xcodebuild -project RemoteMini.xcodeproj -scheme RemoteMini -configuration Release \
  -sdk iphoneos -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' ... build
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

## Files changed

### Core (`ios/Sources/Core/`)
- `PollCursor.swift` — opaque cursor wrapper (raw string in, raw string out, no
  parsing). `.empty` is the documented `""` "fresh" sentinel from `tail.mjs:96`.
- `Backoff.swift` — `Backoff.ms` (port of `frames.mjs:102 backoffMs`) and
  `Backoff.nextAttempt` (port of `view.mjs:305 nextAttempt`).
- `ReadablePoll.swift` — port of `view.mjs:412-425 readablePoll`/`isPlainEvent`,
  operating on the `JSONSerialization` loose tree, not `Decodable`.
- `Credentials.swift` — `Credentials` struct, `CredentialStore` protocol,
  `KeychainError`.
- `KeychainCredentialStore.swift` — Keychain-backed `CredentialStore` implementation.
  `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, no iCloud sync.
- `BackendSession.swift` — shared `URLSession` with a redirect-refusing
  `URLSessionTaskDelegate` (N5) and a 30s request timeout (must exceed the server's
  20s `POLL_MAX_WAIT_MS`, §3-1).
- `HealthzClient.swift` — `GET /healthz` client. Checks `HTTPURLResponse.statusCode`
  before decoding the body (N6).
- `SessionsAuthProbe.swift` — single `GET /api/sessions` call used only to prove the
  API key during Key-entry.

### Screens (`ios/Sources/Screens/KeyEntry/`)
- `KeyEntryViewModel.swift` — healthz-then-sessions-probe flow, Keychain save on
  success, the three §5-1 error messages.
- `KeyEntryView.swift` — `Form` with Base URL / API Key fields, no default host
  anywhere (placeholder is a bare `"https://"` scheme).

### App wiring
- `AppState.swift` (new) — loads stored credentials at launch, holds them for the
  session.
- `RootView.swift` (edited) — now shows Key-entry when no credentials are stored, a
  minimal signed-in placeholder otherwise. `BuildInfo` enum (depended on by the
  pre-existing `BuildInfoTests.swift`) is untouched, still in this file.

### Tests (`ios/Tests/`)
- `Support/MockURLProtocol.swift` — hermetic `URLProtocol` stub (no real network
  I/O); `makeSession()` builds a plain stubbed `URLSession`.
- `Core/PollCursorTests.swift`, `Core/BackoffTests.swift`,
  `Core/ReadablePollTests.swift`, `Core/KeychainCredentialStoreTests.swift`,
  `Core/HealthzClientTests.swift`, `Core/SessionsAuthProbeTests.swift`,
  `Core/RedirectRefusalTests.swift`, `Screens/KeyEntryViewModelTests.swift`.

### `ios/project.yml` (edited — see "Finding" below for why this was necessary)
- Scoped the existing blanket "no code signing" base setting out of
  `iphonesimulator` only, and added `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: YES` to the
  `RemoteMiniTests` target.

## Test list with negative controls (repo convention: every asserted behavior also
proves the easy-to-confuse wrong implementation diverges)

| Test file | Behavior asserted | Negative control |
|---|---|---|
| `PollCursorTests` | Opaque round-trip incl. an unrecognized future cursor format | A naive parse-first-4-segments-and-rejoin reconstruction is shown to actually mangle the unknown format, then shown to differ from the real (untouched) round-trip |
| `BackoffTests` | `ms()` doubles then caps at 15s; `nextAttempt` resets only after `> 5000ms` open, never on a same-tick "opened at all" | Uncapped-formula control diverges at attempt 5; `>=`-boundary control diverges at exactly 5000ms; "any open resets" control diverges on a 1ms flicker connection |
| `ReadablePollTests` | All 12 behavior assertions from `view.test.mjs` lines ~440-464 (tmux shape, worker shape, 7 unreadable shapes, unknown-kind pass-through), plus a JS `typeof`-quirk fidelity case (bare array item not rejected — not exercised by the JS suite, found while porting) | A loosened check (event-presence instead of event-shape) is shown to accept the entries/event-mixup payload the real function must reject; an always-`true` stub is shown to diverge from the real function on an unreadable payload, mirroring `view.test.mjs`'s own "★陰性対照" |
| `KeychainCredentialStoreTests` | Round-trip, overwrite-not-duplicate, clear, empty-load | Deletes the item via the raw `Security` API bypassing the class entirely, then shows `load()` reflects that deletion — an in-memory-cache stand-in would not notice an out-of-band delete |
| `HealthzClientTests` | Success decode; non-200 rejected before decode attempt (N6); malformed-200 body; connection failure | Direct inequality check that `.unexpectedStatus`/`.malformedBody` are genuinely distinct `HealthzError` cases, not the same case reached two ways |
| `SessionsAuthProbeTests` | 200→authorized, 401→unauthorized, other/connection-failure→unreachable, Authorization header carries the bearer key | 401 and 500 outcomes shown to be genuinely distinct `Outcome` values |
| `RedirectRefusalTests` | `RedirectRefusingDelegate` passes `nil` to the completion handler on a 3xx, and `BackendSession` is actually wired with that delegate (not a same-shaped unused class) | A `FollowingDelegate` that makes the easy mistake (echoing the new request back) is shown to actually follow, proving the real assertion could fail |
| `KeyEntryViewModelTests` | healthz-failure short-circuits before probing sessions; wrong-key message; both-pass saves + invokes callback; non-HTTPS rejected before any network call | Direct comparison that the unreachable-URL and wrong-key error strings are genuinely distinct (spec §5-1 requires the two be told apart) |

## Design decisions the spec didn't settle (judgment calls)

1. **`SessionsAuthProbe.Outcome` for non-200/non-401 responses** (5xx, etc.):
   grouped with "server unreachable," not "wrong key" — a 500 is not evidence the
   *key* is wrong. Spec §5-1's table only names the two Key-entry outcomes
   (healthz-unreachable, healthz-ok-but-401); this third case is my extrapolation.
2. **Client-side HTTPS/host validation before any network call** — rejecting a
   non-`https://` or hostless Base URL string immediately, rather than letting it
   reach `HealthzClient` and fail there. Faster/clearer UX; spec §2-1 doesn't say
   either way.
3. **`readablePoll` bare-array-item fidelity** — JS's `typeof it !== "object"` is
   true for both plain objects and arrays (only null/primitives fail it), so a
   bare-array `items[]` entry is *not* rejected by the real function; it has no
   `.kind`, so the loop body is a no-op for it. `view.test.mjs` never exercises this
   input. I ported the quirk verbatim (added `ReadablePollTests
   .testBareArrayItemIsNotRejectedMatchingJSTypeofQuirk` to pin it) rather than
   "fixing" it, per the spec's explicit "そのまま移植" instruction. Flagging this as
   a fidelity finding worth a second look — it's a real behavior a phone will hit if
   the server ever sends an array-shaped item, not a hypothetical.

## Finding: `project.yml` needed a real edit, not an optional one

The existing scaffold's `settings.base` disables code signing entirely
(`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED: NO`) for every SDK, simulator included. Running the
Keychain tests against that build failed all 6 `KeychainCredentialStoreTests` at
`setUpWithError` with `unexpectedStatus(-34018)` (`errSecMissingEntitlement`): a
fully unsigned app has no entitlements blob at all, so the Security framework has
nothing to authorize even the app's own default keychain access group, and denies.

Fix applied (scoped to `iphonesimulator` only via `SETTING[sdk=iphonesimulator*]`):
local ad hoc signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY: "-"`, no Apple Developer account needed)
plus `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: YES` on `RemoteMiniTests` (codesign refused to sign a
target with no Info.plist once signing was turned on for it). Verified this does
**not** touch the on-device path: `tools/build.sh`'s device build passes its own
`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` flags
directly on the `xcodebuild` command line for `-sdk iphoneos`, which win over
anything in `project.yml`; I additionally re-ran that exact device build command
after the edit and confirmed `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` unsigned, same as before.

This was inside my file-ownership boundary (`project.yml` edit only where xcodegen
genuinely requires it) and was a hard blocker for the DoD's stated Keychain unit
tests, not a style preference — I did not defer it.

## DoD items — met / not met

**Met:**
- `PollCursor` opacity test (round-trip incl. unrecognized-format fidelity, negative
  control) — green.
- `backoffMs` upper-bound test (cap + no-early-reset, two negative controls) —
  green.
- `readablePoll` port matches `view.test.mjs` output 1:1, including the tmux
  `entries` / worker `event` distinction and its "取り違え" (mixup) failure mode,
  plus negative controls — green.
- `./tools/build.sh --sim` → `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, exit 0.
- Keychain storage layer, `/healthz` client, Key-entry screen implemented per spec
  §2-1/§5-1 with tests.

**Not met — and why:**
- **On-device verification** (`devicectl device process launch --console`, grep for
  `healthz ok:true pid:<n>`): **not attempted**, per explicit instruction (no
  physical iPhone connected in this environment; team-lead told me not to attempt
  this half of the DoD). The diagnostic line is written and ready —
  `KeyEntryViewModel.swift:49`, `print("healthz ok:\(result.ok) pid:\(result.pid)")`
  — fires immediately after a successful `/healthz` response, before the
  `/api/sessions` probe, contains no key/credential material (verified: only
  `print(` call in `Sources/`, grepped). This step is the one remaining DoD item and
  needs Tom's phone.

## Constraint compliance (self-check against the 7 hard constraints)

1. No GUI opened — every command below was `xcodebuild`/`xcodegen`/`grep` via Bash,
   no `open -a Simulator`, no Xcode.
2. File ownership respected — touched only `ios/Sources/**`, `ios/Tests/**`,
   `ios/project.yml` (justified above), `.harness/progress.md`. Did not touch
   `rc-backend/**`, `DESIGN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, or the spec file.
3. Secrets — grepped `Sources/` for `print(` (one hit, the diagnostic line, no
   `apiKey` in it) and for URL literals (none — only a placeholder string and an
   error-message hint). No real key anywhere in test fixtures (all `*-fixture-key*`
   / `unit-test-fixture-key-not-real`).
4. No hardcoded host — grepped `Sources/` for `https?://`; the only two hits are the
   Key-entry placeholder text (`"https://"`, bare scheme) and a Japanese error
   string instructing the user what to type. Every test fixture host uses the RFC
   2606 reserved `.invalid` TLD.
5. `PollCursor` opacity — `wireValue` is the only stored property, set once at
   `init(raw:)`, never parsed/reconstructed; verified via the round-trip +
   unrecognized-format tests above.
6. Every test has a negative control — table above; none of the 8 test files lacks
   one.
7. `readablePoll` stays client-side — implemented only in `Sources/Core/`, nothing
   added to `rc-backend/`, and I did not add or rely on any server-computed
   `display.readablePoll` field.
